# A motion tracking library

Libmv is a motion tracking library; it powers Blender's motion tracker. This is only a mirror of the official repository; ~~see the official site for build & develop instructions: https://developer.blender.org/tag/libmv/~~ **Site now defunct,** see the [archived version](http://web.archive.org/web/20211104101548/https://developer.blender.org/tag/libmv/). The official repository can be found here: https://projects.blender.org/blender/libmv
